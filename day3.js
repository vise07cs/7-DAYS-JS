// Do you understand DOM , can you define whats the difference between event bubbling and event capturing 

// Event Bubbling

// Event bubbling is a concept in the DOM (Document Object Model) event propagation where an event starts from the target element (where the event occurred) and propagates upwards through its parent elements, up to the root (document).
// if the child element doesnt have any event associated and parent element has an event , then also event will be triggered when an event is triggered on parent element

// null and undefined and not defined in javascript and difference between them;

// undefined

// A variable is declared but has not been assigned any value.
// JavaScript automatically assigns undefined to uninitialized variables.

// ex-1
let a;
console.log(a)   

// not defined

// A variable is not declared at all in the code.
// Accessing an undeclared variable results in a ReferenceError.

// ex-2 of not defined
console.log(b)


// null
// null is an explicit assignment that represents "no value" or "empty."
// It must be manually assigned by the developer.


let c=null;
console.log(c)
